# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

## Learning Objectives
What you should learn from this project:

* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the flags `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` and `-pedantic`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are allowed to use the standard library
* In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `binary_trees.h`
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded

## Data structures
Please use the following data structures and types for binary trees. Don’t forget to include them in your header file.

# Basic Binary Tree
```C
/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
```
# Binary Search Tree
```C
typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;
```
# AVL Tree
```C
typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;
```
# Max Binary Heap
```C
typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;
```
Note: For tasks 0 to 23 (included), you have to deal with simple binary trees. They are not BSTs, thus they don’t follow any kind of rule.

Print function
To match the examples in the tasks, you are given this [function](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x1C.c)

* When created, a node does not have any child
* Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or `NULL` on failure

* And `value` is the value to store in the node to be inserted
* Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or `NULL` on failure
* If the address stored in `tree` is `NULL`, the created node must become the root node.
* If the value is already present in the tree, it must be ignored

Your file `0-binary_tree_node.c` will be compiled during the correction

### [29. Big O #BST](./115-O)
What are the average time complexities of those operations on a Binary Search Tree (one answer per line):

* Inserting the value `n`
* Removing the node with the value `n`
* Searching for a node in a BST of size n

### [30. Is AVL](./120-binary_tree_is_avl.c)
Write a function that checks if a binary tree is a valid AVL Tree

* Prototype: `int binary_tree_is_avl(const binary_tree_t *tree);`
* Where `tree` is a pointer to the root node of the tree to check
* Your function must return `1` if `tree` is a valid AVL Tree, and `0` otherwise
* If `tree` is `NULL`, return `0`

Properties of an AVL Tree:

* An AVL Tree is a BST
* The difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one
* The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree

### [31. AVL - Insert](./121-avl_insert.c)
Write a function that inserts a value in an AVL Tree

* Prototype: `avl_t *avl_insert(avl_t **tree, int value);`
* Where `tree` is a double pointer to the root node of the AVL tree for inserting the value
* And `value` is the value to store in the node to be inserted
* Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or `NULL` on failure
* If the address stored in `tree` is `NULL`, the created node must become the root node.
* The resulting tree, after insertion, must be a balanced AVL Tree

* Where `array` is a pointer to the first element of the array to be converted
* And `size` is the number of elements in the array

* Where `root` is a pointer to the root node of the tree for removing a node
* And `value` is the value to remove in the tree
* Once located, the node containing a value equals to value must be removed and freed
* If the node to be deleted has two children, it must be replaced with its first `in-order successor` (not predecessor)
* After deletion of the desired node, the tree must be rebalanced if necessary
* Your function must return a pointer to the new root node of the tree after removing the desired value, and after rebalancing

### [35. Big O #AVL Tree](./125-O)
What are the average time complexities of those operations on an AVL Tree (one answer per line):

* Inserting the value `n`
* Removing the node with the value `n`
* Searching for a node in an AVL tree of size n

### [36. Is Binary heap](./130-binary_tree_is_heap.c)
Write a function that checks if a binary tree is a valid Max Binary Heap

* Prototype: `int binary_tree_is_heap(const binary_tree_t *tree);`
* Where `tree` is a pointer to the root node of the tree to check
* Your function must return `1` if tree is a valid Max Binary Heap, and `0` otherwise
* If `tree` is `NULL`, return `0`

Properties of a Max Binary Heap:
* It’s a complete tree
* In a Max Binary Heap, the value at root must be maximum among all values present in Binary Heap
* The last property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree

### [37. Heap - Insert](./131-heap_insert.c)
Write a function that inserts a value in Max Binary Heap

* Prototype: `heap_t *heap_insert(heap_t **root, int value)`
* Where `tree` is a double pointer to the root node of the Heap to insert the value
* And `value` is the value to store in the node to be inserted
* Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or `NULL` on failure
* If the address stored in `tree` is `NULL`, the created node must become the root node.
* You have to respect a Max Heap ordering
* You are allowed to have up to 6 functions in your file
